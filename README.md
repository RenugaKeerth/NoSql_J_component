In  the  present  generation,  the  social  life  of everyone has become associated with online social networks. These sites have made a drastic change in the way we pursue our  social  life.  Making  friends  and  keeping  in  contact  with them  and  their  updates  has  become  easier.  But  with  their rapid   growth,   many   problems   like   fake   profiles,   online impersonation   have   also   grown.There   are   no   feasible solutions exist to control these problems. In this paper, I came up with a framework with which the automatic identification of fake profiles is possible and is efficient. This framework uses classification  techniques  like  Random  Forest  Classifier  to classify the profiles into fake or genuine classes. As this is an automatic detection method, it can be applied easily by online social networks that have  millions of profiles whose profiles cannot be examined manually.
